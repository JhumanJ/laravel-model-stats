This Laravel packages gives you a statistic dashboard for you Laravel application. Think of it as a light version of 
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/), but built-in your Laravel application, and much easier to get started with. 
No code knowledge is required to use Laravel Model Stats, users can do everything from the web interface. It also 
optionally supports custom-code widgets, allowing you to define your widget data with
code, just like you would do with tinker.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require jhumanj/laravel-model-stats
```

You can install the package and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan model-stats:install
php artisan migrate
```


## Available No-Code Widgets

Different type of widgets (daily count, daily average, etc.) are available. When creating a widget,
you choose a Model, an aggregation type and the column(s) for the graph. You can then resize and move the widgets around on your dashboard.

The aggregation types currently available:
- Daily Count (Number of records per day during selected period).
- Cumulated Daily Count (Cumulated Total record count during selected period).
- Period Total (Number of new records during selected period).
- Group By Count (Count per group for a given column during selected period).
- ... (more to come soon)

For each widget type, date can be any column: `created_at`,`updated_at`,`custom_date`.

## Custom Code Widgets

You can also use custom code widgets, allowing you to define your widget data with
code, just like you would do with tinker.

Your code must define a `$result` variable containing the data to return to the choosen chart. You can use the `$dateFrom` and `$dateTo` variable.

Example custom code for a bar chart:

```php 
$result = [
    'a' => 10,
    'b' => 20
];
```

### Custom Code Setup
ðŸš¨ Using the custom code feature against a production database is a HUGE risk ðŸš¨

Any malicious user with access to the dashboard,
or any mistake can cause harm to your database. Do not do that. Here's a safe way to use this feature:
- Create a `read-only` database user with access to your database
  - Here's how to create a read-only user for a PostgreSQL database: [PostgreSQL guide](https://tableplus.com/blog/2018/04/postgresql-how-to-create-read-only-user.html)
  - Here's how to create a read-only user for a MySQL database: [MySQL guide](https://ubiq.co/database-blog/create-read-only-mysql-user/)
- Add a readonly database connection to your `config/database.php` file
  ```php
  // in database.php
  
  'connections' => [
  
    // ... your other connections
  
     'readonly' => [
            'driver' => 'pgsql',  // Copy the settings for the driver you use, but change the user
            'url' => env('DATABASE_URL'),
            'host' => env('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
            'port' => env('DB_PORT', '5432'),
            'database' => env('DB_DATABASE', 'forge'),
            'username' => env('DB_USERNAME_READONLY', 'forge'), // User is changed here
            'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD_READONLY', ''),
            'charset' => 'utf8',
            'prefix' => '',
            'prefix_indexes' => true,
            'schema' => 'public',
            'sslmode' => 'prefer',
        ],
  ]
- In your .env set the following:
  ```dotenv
    MODEL_STATS_CUSTOM_CODE=true
    MODEL_STATS_DB_CONNECTION=readonly
    DB_USERNAME_READONLY=<username>
    DB_PASSWORD_READONLY=<password>
    ```
Thanks to this, the package will use the readonly connection when executing your code. 
Note that this a protection against mistakes, but not against malicious users. One can override this 
connection in the custom code, so there are still some risks associate with using this feature in production.
Be sure that your dashboard authorization is properly configured.

### Disabling Custom Code
You may want to disable custom code widgets by setting the `MODEL_STATS_CUSTOM_CODE` env variable to `false`.

## Dashboard Authorization

The ModelStats dashboard may be accessed at the `/stats` route. By default, you will only be able to access this 
dashboard in the local environment. Within your `app/Providers/ModelStatsServiceProvider.php` file, there is an 
authorization gate definition. This authorization gate controls access to ModelStats in non-local environments. 
You are free to modify this gate as needed to restrict access to your ModelStats installation: 

```php 
/**
 * Register the ModelStats gate.
 *
 * This gate determines who can access ModelStats in non-local environments.
 *
 * @return void
 */
protected function gate()
{
    Gate::define('viewModelStats', function ($user) {
        return in_array($user->email, [
            'taylor@laravel.com',
        ]);
    });
}
```

## Upgrading

Be sure to re-publish the front-end assets when upgrading ModelStats:
```
php artisan model-stats:publish
```
